    <h1>"Meta Tag"</h1>
    <p>Meta tags are snippets of code that tell search engines important information 
        about your web page, such as how they should display it in search results.<BR>
         They also tell web browsers how to display it to visitors.</p>
         <hr>
    <H1>"TYPES OF META TAG":</H1>
    <hr >
    <dl>
        <dt><h1>Meta title</h1></dt>
        <dd>This is the page title that Google 
            and most other search engines show in search results.
            Titles are critical to giving users a quick insight into the content of a result and why it’s relevant to their query. It’s 
            often the primary piece of information used to decide which result to click on, 
            so it’s important to use high-quality titles on your web pages.</dd>
        <dt><h1>Meta description</h1></dt>
        <dd>The meta description summarizes the page’s content. 
            Search engines often use it for the snippet in search results.
            A meta description tag should generally inform and interest users with a short,
             relevant summary of what a particular page is about. They are 
            like a pitch that convinces the user that the page is exactly what they’re looking
             for.</dd>
        <dt><h1>Meta robots</h1></dt>
        <dd>The meta robots tag tells search engines if and how 
            they should crawl your web pages.
            1.index: tells bots to index the page;
            2.noindex: tells bots not to index the page;
            3.follow: tells bots to crawl links on the page, and
             that you also vouch for them;
            4.nofollow: tells bots not to 
            crawl links on the page, and that no endorsement is implied.        
        </dd>
        <dt><h1>Meta refresh redirect</h1></dt>
        <dd>A meta refresh tag tells the web browser 
            to redirect the user to a different URL after a set amount of time.
            Meta refresh redirect tags are important for SEO in the sense that
             you should not use them, even though Google understands and respects them.</dd>
        <dt><h1>Meta charset</h1></dt>
        <dd>The meta charset tag sets the character encoding for the web page. 
            In other words, it tells the browser how the text on your web page
             should be displayed.
             There are hundreds of different character sets, 
             but the two most common on the web are:
             * UTF-8 - Character encoding for Unicode;
             * ISO-8859-1 - Character encoding for the Latin alphabet.</dd>
        <dt><h1>Meta viewport</h1></dt>
        <dd>A meta viewport tag sets the visible area of a web page. It is used to instruct the 
            browser how to render the page on different screen sizes (i.e., desktop/tablet/mobile)
            Google says that the “presence of this tag indicates to Google that the page is mobile-friendly.” 
            This matters because  Google ranks mobile-friendly web pages higher in 
            mobile search results as of 2015..</dd>
